[2025-03-31T08:08:24.642Z] Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.
[2025-03-31T08:08:24.642Z] 
[2025-03-31T08:08:24.642Z] This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
[2025-03-31T08:08:24.642Z] [0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the

[2025-03-31T08:08:24.642Z] declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
